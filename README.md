##README.md
- Not very original theme but I plan on eventually having a never ending reddit theme...
- Work in progress for [oneK](http://onekb.net/) submission
- Latest version can be seen [here](http://addison.im/oneK)
- Can sort by subreddit by adding the subreddit in the url like so: "oneK/pics/" or "oneK/webdev/"
- index.min.php is 956 bytes but uses the XSLT file so it is really around 2 KB
- Plan on adding a pure PHP version that I should be able to get down to 1 KB but I don't think there will be space for styles
